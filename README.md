# QuantizedConvolutionalNeuralNetwork_FPGA

Alternative version of ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork_FPGA that performs a Quantization of the input values of the CNN. A process of dequantization/quantization is also performed between the layers of the CNN for simplicity and testing purposes, in the practial implementation it could be removed, gaining a further speed-up.
